= Setting up the Free Feeds for YouTube WordPress Plugin =

The Feeds for YouTube plugin is brand new and so we're currently working on improving our documentation for it. If you have an issue or question please submit a support ticket and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

1) Once you've installed the "Feeds for YouTube" plugin click on the "Feeds for YouTube" item in your WordPress menu

2) Click on the large blue YouTube login button to get your YouTube Access Token and YouTube Refresh Token. Note; if you have your own YouTube Developer Project set up then you can enter your YouTube API key by enabling the checkbox below the YouTube login button.

3) Authorize the Feeds for YouTube plugin to read data about your YouTube videos and YouTube channel.

4) YouTube sends back your YouTube Access Token and YouTube Refresh Token which are then automatically saved by the Feeds for YouTube plugin. This information is required in order to connect to the YouTube API.

5) Enter a YouTube channel name to display videos from.

6) Navigate to the Customize and Style pages to customize your YouTube feed.

7) Once you've customized your YouTube feed, click on the "Display Your Feed" tab for directions on how to display your YouTube feed (or multiple YouTube feeds).

8) Copy the [youtube-feed] shortcode and paste it into any page, post or widget where you want the YouTube feed to appear.

9) You can paste the [youtube-feed] shortcode directly into your page editor.

10) You can use the default WordPress 'Text' widget to display your Feeds for YouTube in a sidebar or other widget area.

11) View your website to see your YouTube feed(s) in all their glory!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I display multiple YouTube feeds on my site or on the same page? =

Yep. You can display multiple YouTube feeds by using our built-in shortcode options, for example: `[youtube-feed channel="smashballoon" num=3]`.

= How do I embed a YouTube gallery directly into a WordPress page template? =

You can embed your YouTube gallery directly into a template file by using the WordPress [do_shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/do_shortcode) function: `<?php echo do_shortcode('[youtube-feed]'); ?>`.

= Will Feeds for YouTube work with W3 Total Cache or other caching plugins? =

The Feeds for YouTube plugin should work in compatibility with most, if not all, caching plugins, but you may need to tweak the settings in order to allow the YouTube feed to update successfully and display your latest posts.  If you are experiencing problems with your YouTube feed not updating then try disabling either 'Page Caching' or 'Object Caching' in W3 Total Cache (or any other similar caching plugin) to see whether that fixes the problem and the YouTube feed displays and updates successfully.

= Can I change whether the YouTube video autoplays or plays on click =

Yep, just use the following setting: Feeds for YouTube > Customize > Video Experience > When does video play? You can then set the YouTube video to play when clicked or to autoplay.

= How can I change the layout of my YouTube video feed? =

This free plugin has several layout options built into it. Use the settings in the following location to display your YouTube videos in a list, grid, or gallery layout: Feeds for YouTube > Customize > Layout.  You can also change the spacing/padding between the YouTube videos by using the "Spacing between videos" setting in this same section.

= Can I select how many YouTube videos should be displayed in the feed? =

Yep, you can choose to display between 1-50 YouTube videos in your feed by using the following setting: Feeds for YouTube > Customize > Layout > Number of Videos. The plugin also contains a "Load More" button to allow you to infinitely load more YouTube videos into your feed.

= Will my YouTube gallery be responsive to accommodate mobile visitors? =

Yes. All YouTube feed layouts are completely mobile responsive. Using the plugin's gallery layout will automatically scroll visitors to the YouTube video player to view the video when the video thumbnail is clicked.

= Will videos from my YouTube channel be cached? =

Yes. The Feeds for YouTube plugin will cache all of the posts collected from the YouTube API. Your YouTube videos and information about your YouTube channel can then be retrieved and used for future page loads.

= How do I find the nickname of channel ID for different YouTube channels? =

You can display videos from any YouTube channel using the unique YouTube channel ID. This can be found by viewing the channel page on YouTube and looking at the end of the URL. ex: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1a2b3c4D5F6g7i8j9k. You can also use the channel nickname.

= How does the plugin retrieve my YouTube videos? =

The plugin connects to YouTube and requests data about videos from your YouTube channel in three ways: The RSS feed associated with each YouTube Channel, using the Smash Balloon app and the YouTube API, and using an API Key to connect to the YouTube API. The plugin uses each connection type in certain circumstances with the main concern of optimizing API calls overall.

= Will displaying my YouTube channel affect the time it takes to load the page? =

The Feeds for YouTube plugin has a few features to minimize the impact it has on page load time. For example, iframes for playing YouTube videos are not loaded until the feed is interacted with by a visitor. Thumbnails of your YouTube videos are the smallest resolution necessary relative to the size of the feed. Also, these video thumbnails are not loaded until the rest of the content on the page is loaded.

= How often do new videos from my YouTube channel appear in the YouTube gallery? =

By default, the plugin retrieves new YouTube videos for your YouTube gallery once every hour. You can reduce this to as little as 15 minutes if needed. You can even set your YouTube gallery to update using WordPress cron in the background so the caching process is not relying on the page with your YouTube gallery being visited.
